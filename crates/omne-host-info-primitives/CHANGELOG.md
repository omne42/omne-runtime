## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- detect musl/Alpine Linux hosts before selecting the default target triple so callers do not
  incorrectly fall back to `*-unknown-linux-gnu`
- stop Linux host libc detection from executing ambient `getconf`/`ldd`, and fail closed instead
  of defaulting unknown Linux hosts to `*-unknown-linux-gnu`
- add checked target-triple and executable-suffix helpers that return structured errors for blank
  or unsupported triples, while making the legacy compatibility wrappers fail closed instead of
  forwarding unsupported inputs or misclassifying unknown triples as Windows targets
